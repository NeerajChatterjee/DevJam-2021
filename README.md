## Introduction: 

  

Team Hypertext Assassins main moto is to provide a website where student can access multiple features in a single place.  

### The features we are implementing are: 

> _**Search Engine**_: It takes input as text and voice and uses Wikipedia and Wolfarm to give correct results. 

> _**Note maker**_: It converts the voice input to text and then stores the content into a file so that the student can access it in doc format. 

> _**File Extension converter**_: It converts the given image file(jpg/jpeg/png) and doc/docx file to pdf format. 

### Chrome Extension:

> _**MNNIT Connect**_: It has a timer that shut down the tabs automatically. Clients can enter the time and the tabs that they want to close after a certain period. The extension helps students from long time distractions like YouTube, Social media etc.

> _**MNNIT MeetCalm**_: It hides the sensitive data by making a specific part blur. Students/Faculties can select the areas to blur and use them while doing screen sharing.
